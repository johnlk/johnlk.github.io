      Welcome to John Kuhn's study abroad blog. This is simply to answer some of the questions 
      my family and friends constantly have about my trip. It also serves as a chance for me to go back 
      and reflect on my trip when my trip concludes, and I begin to start forgetting about the funnier  
      day to day events. I'm actively posting articles, so feel free to check back regularly. </p>

      <p>
        The 18th marks my first day in Sweden. I had just spent around 13 hours traveling from O'Hare airport 
        to Arlanda in Sweden. Being as I couldn't get into my Uppsala apartment until Monday, 
        I spent the weekend in Stockholm which was just a 20 min train ride away. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The picture above is a photo I took almost immediately after I got off my plane after landing at Arlanda. 
        I had only received about 90 mins of sleep on the seven hour flight, and I certainly wouldn't describe it 
        as good sleep as the sleep came in irregular twenty minute intervals. I did enjoy that the plane had episodes 
        of "Nathan for You" to watch. I ended up watching all four of the available episodes. After getting off 
        the plane, getting my luggage, and asking someone about how to get to Stockholm, I was finally on a train 
        towards Stockholm. My first impression of Sweden is the green scenery. Lots of trees and green. The usual 
        corn and soybean fields I was used to seeing in Indiana were replaced by plains of green grass. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I had finally arrived in Stockholm it was around 7am, which was a late 1am at home. While I was tired 
        from traveling the past day and was wanting to rest, I needed to find a hotel to stay. Using google maps, I 
        lugged my luggage up the cobblestone roads looking for a hotel. I ended up stopping at three different 
        hotels all of which were full due to a festival being in town. After the third hotel, I booked a room at the 
        Sheraton online on my phone and hailed an Ãœber. I could've walked to the Sheraton as I had to the others, 
        but I was already sweating like crazy and didn't want to look any more out of place then I already knew I did. 
        As a side note, it was 65 degrees or so with a slight breeze which ended up being heavenly once I started 
        sweating, so it certainly could've been worse. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My room was super nice and featured a US outlet and a king size bed, which I would eventually pass out on 
        around 1pm for a three hour nap. My first meal in Stockholm was at a place called Max, which is probably 
        the Swedish equivalent of McDonalds. It was a pretty good burger with nothing unexpected. The Coke I had 
        ordered was just a slightly different taste than I was used to. The Coke in Stockholm had a slightly stronger 
        aftertaste; the pop was a bit more bitter than the U.S. version. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretty much everyone in Sweden speaks perfect English, and I never had any trouble navigating around the 
        city or talking to people. The English I hear in Sweden is even better than some of my professors at home, 
        but to be fair the Swedes have been learning English since elementary school.

      <p>
        Today was a good day because I was able to get 10,000 steps in before noon just walking around exploring 
        the city. I was also able to meet up with some other Purdue students. These students were studying as 
        exchange students at the Swedish Royal Institute KTH in Stockholm. I was able to meet up with them at 
        a barbecue their school was having for their arriving international students. I was worried I wouldn't 
        be able to enter because I didn't have the wristband denoting a KTH international student, but it worked 
        out because they let me in anyway. This barbecue had Germans, Austrians, Spaniards, you name it. I was 
        able to talk with a couple Catalans from Madrid that spoke really good English. It was great because 
        although everyone was from different countries, they all spoke in English to each other. English is the 
        universal language everyone is learning, especially if you're an engineering student in Europe. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I was able to end my day hanging out with those Purdue students and an Austrian student we had met. 
        We went out and got a drink at a place we had found on an app that displayed bars with beers under 30 
        krona, which is like $3.30. It was my very first time in a bar as I'm only 20 and that doesn't fly in 
        the U.S.; however, the Europeans didn't even check my ID. Different cultures are great.

      <p>
        Today was my first day to Uppsala. I was staying in the Sheraton downtown Stockholm for the weekend 
        and needed to checkout by noon that day. I was on a bit of a schedule because I had to make it to 
        my apartment building while it was still open from 13:00 - 16:00. As my luck had it, the moment I 
        found my train, the doors closed on me like a movie. There was a woman there who was super nice and 
        told me the next train to Uppsala was coming in a half hour. About a $10 mistake for being just 30 
        seconds late, but no harm no foul.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went ahead and bought the next train's tickets on my phone which went fine, expect that it never 
        emailed me my ticket, just a credit card confirmation. I downloaded the SJ app for Swedish trains and 
        tried to download my ticket there, but all I could get was the ticket for the last train. Now I worried 
        about not having a ticket and boarding the train, and the idea of presenting the old ticket crossed my 
        mind. They let me on without having to show my ticket, but I knew they would be sending a guy to come 
        check the ticket I didn't have. Keep in mind, everything on the app was totally in Swedish, and I was 
        still attempting to download my ticket on my phone. Sure enough, here comes the ticket checking guy. I 
        was able to explain my situation in English, which he understood, and I showed him my purchase number 
        which was good enough for him, so it all worked out, as most things do. Really there's no reason to worry 
        ever. Even had I been arrested for not paying my ticket, I could've appeared on that TV show "Locked Up 
        Abroad", maybe even received a book deal too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uppsala ended up being a great choice as the city is even more beautiful than Stockholm was, and it has 
        tons of people outdoors with their dogs or on their bikes. In fact, it reminded me about a conversation 
        I had with a Swedish professor on my plane rider over. She said there's a running joke that every Swedish 
        student puts "love being outdoors" for the hobbies section on their resumes. The picture I posted for this 
        entry is actually a castle built in 1549, super old. Uppsala University is super old too, founded in 1477 
        makes it the oldest university in Scandinavia and fourth oldest in all of Europe. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I successfully got into my apartment and got settled in. Only one other person that I can tell is moved 
        in on my hall. Unlike the KTH students I had met over the weekend, most Uppsala students are waiting to 
        arrive for another week because classes don't start for another two.

        After three daily articles in a row, this newest one is coming as a recap of the last several days. My 
        first few days in Sweden were spent mostly by myself as I arrived very early compared to most students 
        whom are now finally trickling in. During those first days, despite the pace of travel and the business of 
        finding my way around, there we're plenty of lulls and downtime to write blog posts. It seems when fun 
        things begin to actually happen, the blog posts get pushed by the wayside. It's most likely the days I 
        have time to write blog posts are the boring days of reflection on my interesting moments the days before. 
        One of my favorite comedians Mitch Hedberg had a joke where his buddy said to him, "hey come look at 
        this picture of me when I was younger", to which Mitch replied, "every picture is of you when you 
        were younger". In the same way, a blog post is a documentation of past events.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know how philosophic I want these posts to be. I'm not sure if people will read and enjoy my 
        thoughts, and I'm not sure what they want to get out of it. Do artists care about their audience base, or do they just 
        paint or play? Maybe the art is therapeutic to them and wasn't meant to be consumed. I'm sure there are 
        plenty of artists throughout history that required therapy through art, and I'm sure we know their names 
        because of the intense emotions they put into their work. My favorite musician Kurt Cobain certainly 
        didn't mind if people listened to him or not. In fact, he hated being famous and how superficial his 
        relationships became. He was one of the greatest singers because he had this quality called "release". 
        He could yell without yelling and push his voice without fear. Most all singers hit a glass ceiling 
        because they are trying to contain their voice or control it. In the same way, I guess I should write 
        thoughts as they come and as fearlessly as I can, trying my best to maintain a voice without reserving myself 
        and creating a glass ceiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last few days while mostly boring and uneventful, I had some good moments. I was able to finish some 
        code for a project I'm working on with another Purdue student and begin getting our app tested and into 
        user's hands. I met my buddy group leader, as well as some floor mates who later met me for dinner at 
        a local pub. The pub, although being totally Swedish, had amazing chicken wings. I know nothing of 
        Sweden or if they typically make chicken wings, but I did notice the local McDonald's sold chicken 
        wings, unlike the United States. So maybe the Swedes enjoy chicken more than we do. If that's the case 
        great, I love me some wings.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a common rule when meeting people that goes something like you should never bring up politics 
        or religion ever ever ever. Well, all of my meetings with people over food have gotten into the realm 
        of politics, religion, or both. I'm having a hard time deciding if it is coincidental or not. I myself 
        love reading about politics and would say I keep myself in the loop pretty well and can keep up with most 
        all things politics. Maybe I'm driving conversations towards politics, but maybe as international students 
        we're very inquisitive of the other person's culture and state, which naturally leads into the realm of 
        politics. Either way, I hope this trend continues. What a bad thing to repress political conversation, 
        in the name of courteousness. The way I see it, you should be changing your mind about something about 
        every year of your life. To think you have all the correct thoughts as a 20 something is insane, and 
        not talking to people about your beliefs is how you keep them forever and never challenge them. Talking,  
        questioning, and challenging (usually) exposes the best ideas. If your thoughts didn't stand up, great, because 
        now you just kicked something stupid you would've held onto for potentially a long time. The alternative 
        is even better, the ability to help someone else along and show them the way out of bad logic or what 
        have you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll finish with this thought. We should strive to have "release" in all we do. Take it from Walt Disney, 
        "Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind."
      </p>

        I'm thinking about what I'm going to write this post about, and then I see that I had written "August 24st" 
        like an idiot on my last post heading to no correction for 5 days. You want people to read your blog but 
        after a mistake like that, you hope no one is reading your blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today was a little slow to start but a good day nonetheless. I was able to enjoy a welcome ceremony from Uppsala 
        University for its international population, which was a little boring but interesting too. I was able to 
        learn a good bit about the history of the "Nations" here at Uppsala as well as the founding history of the 
        University. Uppsala is actually the oldest University in Scandinavia founded in 1477 and one of the oldest 
        in all of Europe. The interesting parts of the history lesson revolved around the Student Nations. Back in 
        the 19th century when students would come to study, the time required to get back to Stockholm as an example
        was 2 days if the weather permitted, sometimes the trek took as much as 5. For a comparison, I was able to 
        take a train ride to Stockholm from Uppsala that lasted a half hour. In the 1800's, a student coming to study 
        at Uppsala was so much more disconnected from their family than a college student today. To compensate, the 
        Student Nations were founded and represented each of the regions in Sweden such that someone could keep up 
        with their communities at home. They were able to meet with people from their town, receive their local news
        through their Nation, and when one of the members made the trip back home, they would deliver mail to the other 
        members' family. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, the Nations are still around, but are not based on the localities of Sweden from which you're from, and 
        many international students join them. They are unlike Greek housing in the US however because the Nations are 
        for both sexes, and no one lives at the nations. Most have their own pubs and libraries as well. Joining a Nation 
        means you can hop around to all the other Nations, so joining one isn't as big a decision as picking a Greek house
        which is the one and only you'll be a part of. Having that Nation card at Uppsala that comes from joining a Nation 
        gets you into all the others. I was able to join GÃ¤strike-HÃ¤lsinge Nation yesterday afternoon because they had
        hosted a couple of fun events I had already been too, and I didn't want to worry about getting a Nation card 
        anymore. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond joining a Nation and hearing about Uppsala history, I was able to practice my Spanish last night as well 
        as today. Do you remember the ice breaker question, "what super power would you want in real life"? The classic 
        answers are flight, x-ray vision, the ability to teleport. None of those answers would give you the freedom the 
        super power of speaking every language would allow. I took Spanish for 3 years in high school and again for a 
        semester in college. I was good. Just after a year of not speaking it, I was horrible at conversing with native 
        speakers. To be able to just speak any language perfectly with no effort would allow you a freedom to travel, 
        meet, relate, and engage with people in a way only a few can now. One of the perks that enticed me, not enough 
        to fully commit to applying, about the CIA data science position I had a chance to apply for, was that they would 
        adjust your salary based on how many languages you were fluent in. Not only that, but they would pay to have a 
        tutor maintain those languages such that you wouldn't lose them. I would use that in a heartbeat as I'm passively
        losing my Spanish as it is, and need to learn Swedish. Then again English is the Universal language and everyone
        I meet, be they from Asia or Europe, they all speak English. So maybe I shouldn't feel bad for not having another 
        language when my native tongue is the universal one, and I don't have the dire need to learn that others have.

        Your browser does not support the view of this sweet backflip.
      </video>
      <p>
        Above is a video of my very first backflip in Sweden. Not bad after not having done it in about 2 weeks. One 
        of the guys in my buddy group was a competitive diver all the way up to the collegiate level, and he was 
        able to give some pointers on my backflip. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, when I go back and recount today's events, all I will remember is the half an hour discussion I had on 
        feminism with a gender studies student. I won't get into the conversation at all, but there were a lot of 
        disagreements. I wasn't offended at any point, but I kept feeling like she was upset with things I had to 
        say. I feel like I'm a nice guy. I certainly don't go out of my way to try and offend people or attack their
        beliefs, but I want to know why people believe what they believe. If I am wrong on an issue, I want to know 
        why and be corrected; however, to get to a point where I am able to understand their level of thinking, I 
        have to risk being offensive. I have to probe and ask about things they may take for granted as obvious. 
        I hope I can still be friends with her. 
      </p>
      <img class="post_image" src="./images/IMG_0554_low.JPG" />
      <p>
        I also was able to get my Uppsala University student ID card today, and I feel like a true Swedish student 
        now. The people who took my picture actually said I was the happiest looking student they had seen on an 
        ID photo. My class schedule is pretty relaxed with just 3-4 classes a week depending on the week, so I 
        should have plenty of time to travel to a few places in Europe while everything is close. I definitely  
        want to go to Florence, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen, but I also want to go with friends instead of being 
        all by my lonesome. I have made several very quick friends here in Uppsala as almost all the exchange 
        students are super friendly, outgoing, and optimistic. Getting to all of those places with the friends
        I've met might require me to organize the trips and ask them to join. I'll get on that soon! 
      </p>
      <p>
        As it happens, I had a chance to practice my Spanish some more today with some Spaniards. It might 
        actually be pretty funny to come back from Sweden after a semester of study reporting that I'm 
        fluent in Spanish instead of Swedish.

        Today was my first day of school in Uppsala Universitet. Before my class began at 10:15 am, I was hoping to 
        get a good night sleep for my first day. I had passed out around 1 am and was sleeping super well. Then 
        my phone started buzzing, because someone was calling me. It was 2:40 in the morning, so I ignored it. 
        After the fifth call, I decided to answer. It wasn't all 
        bad though because it was a friend from Purdue who was also studying abroad. She was planning a trip 
        this weekend to Naples Italy and wanted to include me, but that also meant I had to agree to the purchasing 
        of plane tickets etc. Certainly a good reason for having been woken up, but after organizing final trip 
        details, it was hard to fall back asleep. 
      </p>

        I ended up watching Archer on Netflix until about 4 am when my sister texted me and asked me to get off. 
        For those who don't know, if you're poor and have the cheapest Netflix plan, only one user on the account 
        may view content at one time, ergo my sister wanted me off so she could watch her shows. Ah yes, the first
        text I've received from sister abroad was about me getting off Netflix. Man, I usually don't have an 
        issue falling asleep, but last night was a bear. I even used the trick that almost never fails; I play
        Jim Gaffigan on Spotify. Don't ask me why, but his soothing soft voice always puts me to sleep, except 
        for last night. 
      </p>

        I woke up in plenty of time for getting to my class; however, my bike's rear tire went flat not two 
        minutes after I left my dorm, turning my fifteen minute trip to class into a twenty-five minute one. It also 
        meant me being late to class for my first day. Something you may not think about or notice, but when
        one of your bike tires goes completely pancake on you, the energy required to keep the bike going 
        almost doubles. Couple the extra exertion with the nerves of being late, and I ended up coming to lecture
        super sweaty, probably looking like I had just run to class. I say these things simply because they 
        happened, not because any of them were really a big deal.
      </p>
      <p>
        This post is defiantly not as philosophic as the others, it's just about what I did.
        I bought a Swedish phone plan today and also got a haircut. Oh my goodness, I needed
        a haircut so bad. My hair hadn't been cut since probably June and it was an afro as far as I'm concerned.
        The phone plan was a relief as well because it includes data roaming outside of Sweden for travel. 
      </p>

        Everything on this journey abroad so far has just been a matter of getting more comfortable. The first 
        day you're here it's awkward because you don't know anyone or where you're supposed to go for things, or even
        how the outlets work. But after solving simple problems every day you start to feel pretty comfortable. I felt pretty 
        comfortable after I figured out my classes and my schedule, and once I got a bike. Before I had a bike, 
        getting to town was a forty-minute walk. My next step towards more comfortability would be getting good 
        at ordering food in Swedish. Swedish isn't that hard grammatically or anything that I can tell, but the 
        pronunciation is what's hard. It's like English in that there's not a lot of phonetic rules that are 
        adhered to. Anyways I would pretty pleased if I could order in Swedish and have basic conversations with 
        strangers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I actually was told a joke by a Swede over the weekend. He said, "what do you call someone who only speaks 
        one language?". To which I relied, "unilingual?". He said, "no, you call them American". Ah yes. Well 
        I'll have to learn the language before I leave and be un-American in that sense.

      <p>
        I finished a book today called "The reason for God" by Timothy Keller. I was spurred to read it by the 
        encouragement of my Christian friends from home. I had been raised a Christian and was very adamant about
        my faith all through high school. After studying the theory of evolution and reading books on our 
        universe by Stephen Hawking, I had a lot of trouble combining this new information with my 
        faith. This post is certainly not a defense of my new faith, or lack thereof, but just a giving 
        of context. As it is now, I come down on the side of not believing in God, but I'm totally open 
        to the idea. In fact, it's so much easier to believe in the idea of a creator having a specific plan 
        for me, however solipsistic the idea. To believe someone will take care to equalize all atrocities 
        and injustices experienced here on earth; to know murders and terrorists will receive a punishment not 
        achievable on earth in some instances. What a delight to believe you'll see your whole family again 
        after death in the eternal bliss that is heaven. As it is however, I am unable to go on believing it 
        anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Timothy Keller's book, he goes through some theological issues people usually have with Christianity  
        including why a loving God would send people to hell, or if there can only be one correct religion. All 
        these points were reasonable theologically, and I had no issue with them. I certainly gained a new perspective 
        on the accuracy of the accounts of the bible; however, Keller still left questions unanswered and 
        misrepresented some atheistic positions held by Dawkins and Hitches. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as I could tell Keller's case against Atheism came down on the idea that if there is no divine creator
        then each of our lives have no true purpose, and morality goes right out the window. What a narrow
        view of our species that we have to be told what's right and wrong, not even by God himself, but someone who 
        is the messenger for God. This is an extremely slippery territory. It's all fine and dandy to believe this
        while also believing in Christ's words, but take the words of Mohammad who was supposed to be a messenger for 
        God and you have a morality based on the killing of infidels and the conquering of the world. Let me also 
        pose a question. Is there a single thing a God fearing individual can do in the name of God for the good 
        of the world that an atheist such as myself could not do? I submit the answer to be no. More than that, if 
        I were to ask you to come up with something horribly wicked an individual could do only if they were religiously 
        motivated, I'm sure you could come up with an example extremely quickly.
        On the meaning of life, I also find it a very narrow and bleak view of the world and life therein to believe
        your meaning has to be given to you from upstairs. All of us should want to make advances in science, 
        technology, or even politics such that our fellow brothers and sisters should have an easier life after ours.
        I'm not sure why our value or worth has to come from the feeling that someone is listening to our prayers, it
        seems shallow to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the resurrection of Jesus, I wasn't certain about the validity of the biblical accounts, and this book gave 
        me some more information on the event. Keller's support of the validity of the accounts of Jesus's 
        resurrection stem from the fact that it was so unbelievable that no scholar would want to report it, except 
        if it were true. He gives a working account of the Jewish and Roman beliefs of the time and how unbelievable 
        it would've been to believe someone were resurrected. Even easier to explain, the gospel accounts have women 
        as the first witnesses to the rolled back tomb. At the time, female accounts were considered less than a man's 
        and someone making up the story certainly would've just made the witnesses men. Maybe, I understand the logic, 
        but here's this. I'll give you the miracle that Jesus was resurrected, hell Lazarus, the daughter of Jairus, 
        and a man from Nain were 
        raised from the dead in the gospel accounts without any word about where they had been or what they had experienced.
        What's more is that Jesus opened up the tombs of the saints in Matthew 27:50-53 after his resurrection. Although 
        this last biblical account is debated whether it is figurative or not, it almost seems that 
        resurrection was quite a banality at the time rather 
        than a great miraculous singularity as Keller seems to be painting it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Kelly also describes the quick founding of Christianity and the radically explosive growth after the resurrection
        as evidence the event must have been real. If you want to show the growth of a religion as an example of its
        validity, then I'll show you to Islam where members are constantly sacrificing everything in the pursuit of 
        the religions tenants. Keller would never believe however that Islam has any validity just because of its fast 
        growth and the members' willingness to sacrifice, but this is exactly how he argues about the validity of the 
        resurrection account of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these existential thoughts and talk about the meaning of life are making me think about my ex-girlfriend. I 
        can't explain why. Maybe it's because when you think about your purpose in life, it's natural to think about 
        your family, or in my case a future one. Certainly if I had a child, raising it well would be a lot of my 
        life. I have thoughts sometimes that I made the wrong decision when it came to breaking up with her. I'm not 
        sure if everyone has these thoughts even if it wasn't meant to be, or if I really am acknowledging some truth. 
        I believe it to be the former. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll finish with the acknowledgement that with all things I'm often wrong. I can't find the exact quote, but Teddy 
        Roosevelt said something to the effect of, "I wish to be right just 40% of the time". I'm wrong a lot, 
        and knowing this encourages me to stay humble and test my opinions. As it is, I could be 
        totally wrong about my current irreligious views. This is simply where I am now in my life given the 
        information I've received.

          Well it's been a minute since my last blog post. I'm sorry to those who have been checking for new 
          content only to find that there wasn't any. I've added Google analytics to the blog such that I can 
          investigate if people are reading my stuff. 70 something people have been to my page with about 
          15 regular fans. Cool beans. Well to the 15 who come to check in regularly I appreciate you taking 
          the time to read what I'm writing, because it's so easy to do anything else. All social media sites 
          and any entertainment medium in general is vying for our time; so I appreciate you coming here 
          and for being interested. Although the purpose of this blog isn't to please an audience, I 
          enjoy knowing someone wants to read it.

          Okay so, two weekends ago I went with two friends to Italy where we stayed in an Airbnb in Naples.
          From there we traveled to Rome for a day, and we also spent a day in Pompeii visiting the ruins. 
          Before I left Purdue, they required all study abroad students to attend a before you go seminar, and 
          one of the things I remember most was their talk about the coming "culture shock". While in Sweden I 
          don't think I'll experience a true culture shock, but if I were to stay in Italy for a semester I 
          certainly would experience the supposed shock. Less people speak English in Italy, and drivers have no 
          respect for traffic rules or pedestrians. It certainly didn't feel as clean or as safe as Sweden, 
          but the trip was good nonetheless. Don't let me just tell you all the bad parts only. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Rome was really interesting with lots of beautiful artwork done centuries ago. All day long I looked 
          at impressive pieces of art that I could appreciate, but I could never truly connect to any of it 
          because I didn't know what I was looking at. I also didn't have any connection to the Catholic church, 
          so there wasn't magic in that way either. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In Pompeii, we went to a vineyard under Mount Vesuvius in the red zone. The vineyard had no irrigation 
          surprisingly. This was because the ashy irregular soil trapped pockets of water underground and the 
          grapes always have a supply of water under them. Being only twenty and being unable to drink in the 
          US, I haven't developed a pallet for wine at all. The wine tasting was fine, but just like my art 
          experiences in the Vatican, I couldn't fully appreciate it because I had no reference point. 
        </p>
        <p>
          That's all I have on the trip really. You can look at my images below or look at all my semester 
          images <a href="./image_list.html">here</a>. School is picking up and so is social life as I'm 
          meeting people. I started participating in an acting and skits club at my Nation. Back home, my 
          company is needing more and more attention all the time and we're looking to hire two more people 
          by the end of the week. With lots of priorities and little time, I have to eliminate almost 
          all passive petty amusements and time killers. Anytime I'm watching a YouTube video, which for anyone who knows me 
          knows I do a lot of, I could just as easily be practicing my Swedish or making app updates. I'm also 
          trying to learn Spanish and am dedicating 90 mins a day to listening comprehension and vocab.
        </p>
        <p>
          While being somewhat busy, I certainly think the early twenties will be the best times of my life. I'm 
          caught between the worry of looking back saying I didn't work hard enough in my college years with my 
          business, studies, etc. and the feeling that I'll look back and say I worked too hard and didn't have 
          enough fun. I'll figure it out.

          It's about time I did another check in via my blog. Today I woke up for a class that was a twenty min bike 
          ride from my dorm. The class was actually a three hour lab beginning at 8:15 am. There's a pride associated 
          with waking up early and doing something you know you ought to do, like going to class even when it's early
          and cold. It's so easy to just stay in bed, but if you don't give in and do what 
          you're supposed to, there's a great sense of accomplishment. It's this tiny inner voice that tells me to do what
          it knows to be good for me. CS Lewis describes this inner voice as our innate sense of right and wrong 
          that comes from the spirit parts of our body/soul. Maybe, all I know is I feel bad if I start my day off
          by doing something lazy like skipping class. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I like these little moments of satisfaction when reflecting on something done well like riding to class 
          in the rain. I've been thinking about creating a challenge for myself that would only help my character 
          grow by getting me out of my comfort zone, but would also feed this desire for moments of satisfaction 
          after having done something hard. I was thinking the first part of the challenge would be smiling at 5 
          strangers every day. Such an easy thing to do really, but somewhat of an awkward thing for me, so it seems
          like an appropriate challenge. Maybe I could do something with meeting or complimenting people too? I'm not
          sure, but I'll be sure to let the blog know once I've defined the challenges I want to complete day to day.
        </p>

          I've been pretty busy these last couple weeks working on my company and job applications. I've received a 
          return offer from Salesforce to work with them this next summer, but I think I want to work at a small 
          company. I don't want to jinx anything by talking about it, so I won't, but understand I now have a 
          commitment to re-learning all my algorithms and data structures. So this weekend I'll have to 
          make time to study for a class that I already passed last year because an employer wants to know that I 
          in fact still remember big O. I should be studying for my current classes, or working on my Swedish, or 
          Spanish, and there is plenty of work to do for Stuut my company. I constantly have this internal pressure
          to be productive. It's great when I follow this voice and do a lot of stuff, but I feel awful if I waste 
          a day. 
        </p>
        <p>
          On language learning, I was listening to the Joe Rogan podcast with Elon Musk, and Musk was talking about 
          some of the research at Neuralink. He talked about how we all have this primal hindbrain that takes care
          of our involuntary actions like breathing and heart rate. Next, he explained how our neocortex and 
          our lobes developed around this hind brain like a second layer abstracted from our instincts to support 
          free thought and logic. Finally, he envisioned the possibility of an implant or chip that could assist 
          our frontal lobe by being the 3rd layer of the brain. As I was sitting in Swedish class today unable to 
          recall the words I needed to know to complete a worksheet, I just daydreamed about this chip that could
          translate for me. To never have to look up anything again because you have an absolute storage system 
          like that of a computer, right in your head.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's definitely an adoption period for stuff like this. Some will want a chip in their head tomorrow, 
          and others, including myself, will want to see the bugs worked out. I'm sure people might also associate 
          a chip in people's heads with the mark of the beast in revelation. I was also reading about meat like steak
          that could be grown in a lab. No cow, all the nutrients, but just grown in a petri dish. Sounds great, 
          and solves this massive factory farming problem that has encouraged all these vegetarians; however,
          the article described a remaining "ick factor" as some people still find it unsettling to eat meat that 
          came from a lab.

        I usually have a picture recently taken to introduce a blog post; however, nothing picture worthy has 
        happened this last week and I don't want to force bad content.
      </p>
      <p>
        This last week has been rather boring. I'm starting to grow disinterested in my coursework. I have a class
        on the technologies and systems that support the internet. It's fine learning all the theory, but I 
        have this apathy coming from a thought that sounds about like, "even if I don't understand any of how the 
        internet works, there are plenty of people who will take care of it". It really is amazing how your brain 
        functions. If I sit down to study a chapter from the textbook with the mentality of, "I'm never going to 
        need to know this" my brain just doesn't turn on the recorder and none of the information sticks. The exact 
        same phenomenon is happening in my Swedish class. I want to learn Swedish for the sake of ordering in 
        restaurants and what have you, but after I come back to the US I'm not going to be able to talk to 
        any other Swedish speakers. 
        My brain isn't fooled and doesn't spend the resources on learning in the same way I do with Spanish.
        The difference is simply my mentality going into studying.
        I guess that's why it's important for teachers to express the importance of the information being taught, not
        just spew the material.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm certainly looking forward to the term switching here in a couple weeks such that I can get some new 
        classes. I feel like a lot of my life I'm looking forward to something in the future. This summer while 
        working at 
        Salesforce I definitely had a lot of fun, but I was also looking forward to not having to work anymore and
        starting school in Sweden. Now that I'm in Sweden, I'm totally having fun, but I'm looking forward to coming 
        back to Purdue and spending time with friends and with the relationships I have a lot more time invested in. 
        I'm worried 
        I can't actually be happy if I'm constantly looking to the future in eager anticipation. Can I truly enjoy
        what's in front of me now? I once heard after you retire and have nothing left in your life to look forward
        to, you can fully experience happiness. Part of that might also be because after retiring, the next major
        life event is death and so you kind of have to love the present. As young as I am, I have a lot of life 
        experiences to look forward to.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of this is to say that I'm not happy, because I am. I'm just thinking. I think a lot. I hope my thoughts
        can be interesting to someone else. I can't look outside of my own blog and critically analyze if it's 
        interesting or not. The Chinese have a saying, "don't ask the fish how the water tastes", and don't ask me if
        my blog is interesting or well written. I hope it is. Maybe a frequent reader can notice an improvement in 
        my writing, or can pick up on what type of mood I'm in while writing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if my posts aren't enjoyable to other people, in ten years I will enjoying coming back and reading my 
        thoughts. As they say, everybody's favorite topic is themselves. Try to keep this in mind when talking to 
        people. Dale Carnegie says the best conversationalist asks questions about other people that get them 
        to talk about their life, career, or anything that excites them really. I guess if that's true there's 
        certainly less pressure to tell a good story or be funny if you can just ask questions of another person.
        I think there's a topic between every group of people in the world that both parties can relate to in a
        stimulating way. I've had this experience when talking to someone about comedians. Miraculously, they
        seemed to listen to about as much stand up as I did, which at the time was impressive. I want to know the
        secret of getting to that awesome mutual conversation topic without probing like an interviewer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of interviews, I have one in about 77 mins. I should probably be prepping for that. Vi ses!

        I read two books last week, and I'm reading another this week. As a kid, and through the majority of 
        schooling, I remember hating reading. Now that I'm in college and reading on my own, I actually enjoy it.
        Why is it school can come to make you hate something? Is it because when I'm reading on my own now, I know
        there's not an essay to write or a test to take soon after finishing? Is it because I'm freely choosing 
        which books I want to read?
        I don't know, I'm not a psych major. Anecdotally, I would say there does exist some animosity when it comes
        to following instruction. My parents, especially my dad, were always asking if I had brushed my teeth when I
        was a kid. It was as if him asking me if I had brushed my teeth made me want to un-brush
        my teeth had I brushed them. But looking from his position, if the child was constantly saying no to 
        the question, then clearly reminders were in order. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I definitely would have benefited had I as a child enjoyed brushing my teeth and reading as much as I do now.
        It isn't a joke. I had tons of cavities as a kid. We're talking sometimes four or five cavities found
        during one dentist visit. I know in school we did have the option of choosing our own books to read for 
        some projects. I don't remember writing those reports with any more gusto than the others. Maybe I disliked
        my English teachers. In my experience, they were certainly the laziest teachers. I can't be surprised. When it 
        comes to being a teacher, which I'm sure isn't hard, becoming an English teacher has got to be the 
        easiest.

        Interviewer: Can you speak English?<br>
        Potential English Teacher: Yes. <br>
        Interviewer: Do you know the difference between a demonstrative and an attributive adjective? <br>
        Potential English Teacher: No. <br>
        Interviewer: Me either, but you can just look it up the day before you have to give the lesson. You're hired. 
      </div>
      <p>
        This isn't to say all my English teachers were bad, because they weren't. In fact, my Sophomore and Senior 
        year of high school English teachers were very smart and made me both a better reader and writer. I'm just
        wondering how we could get more kids to enjoy reading, or at least stop making schools make their students
        hate it. I wonder if today's kids are worse off because of the distractions that await them upon returning
        home, like the Xbox and iPad. If this were the case, then we should see an equal lack of homework completion
        in other subjects, not just English.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people still despise reading even out of school. I don't know if you know this, but books exist on almost
        any topic. You can step into some of the greatest and most interesting minds of all time, Richard Feynman, 
        Aristotle, or even 
        Anne Frank just by picking up a book. Reading is learning from another person just like you did with almost 
        any other skill you've learned so far, be it driving, speaking well, or weightlifting. Imagine if you could
        have Arnold Schwarzenegger as a personal trainer. It is commonly argued Arnold Schwarzenegger had one of 
        the greatest bodies ever built. You could step inside his mind and his thought process today, if you just 
        read his books.

        In the <i>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> Stephen R. Covey gives a model for how we should spend 
        our time. He builds two categories of task that every person has to do, important and non-important. He 
        then crosses these attributes with two more that describe tasks as either urgent or non-urgent. You can
        see an example below. We almost always spend all of our time in the urgent column. We do things important
        for right now. To build character, to invest in the future, we should spend our time in quadrant 2.
        Those tasks which are important but not urgent are the ones that make us better listeners, 
        better conversationalists, better friends, and better people.

        This morning I had my first exam in Uppsala. It began at 8am and the testing location was a half 
        an hour bus ride away, which had me setting my alarm for 6:30am. When I got to the testing site
        the doors were closed with people waiting in the lobby. Every once in a while, a man or woman 
        would open the doors and give instructions totally in Swedish. The whole testing experience 
        went fine, but I had a lot of second guesses. For example, my answer sheet went to ten questions,
        but the test only had five free response questions. I had that thought that maybe I had to turn 
        in the first part to get the second part of the exam, but didn't know because I didn't understand
        the Swedish instructions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I also didn't understand how they would issue me a grade because there was not a place for a name 
        on the exam, so I just wrote my name and student ID at the top. When I turned it in, they told 
        me I shouldn't have done this, but the woman was super helpful and we whited it out. Besides
        not being sure where I was supposed to be or what I was supposed to do at times, the exam seemed to go
        fine. I left pretty early compared to everyone else, and I think I passed.

        I hope the blog is loading faster. Just before this post, I wrote a script that replaces the 
        full resolution images with low res ones. Once the page has the full res assets loaded it'll swap the 
        low-res image for the full size image. This blog is one of the only projects I've worked on where
        it was less about the code. I don't want to write all these optimizations and make the site beautiful, 
        which you've probably already noticed. I would rather I spend time on the content.

        This week I turned down a summer internship offer that paid pretty darn well, and I don't have another 
        offer in front of me yet. I'm going totally against the advice, "a bird in the hand is worth two in 
        the bush". Kind of a silly phrase when applied to life decisions like a girlfriend or summer job.
        "Well I was gonna break up with her, but you know what they say, don't want to grab at two birds and 
        come up empty". With girls and jobs there are way more than just the first two birds even if you miss
        those. I'm trying to land a position at a smaller company or a startup. I don't know;
        we'll see what happens I guess. I'm thrown my resume at a lot of places and already been interviewed 
        by Google, so I'm certainly not worried.

        This last week I started into some Unity development. For the non-nerds of the world, Unity is a game
        development engine. I went ahead and created a flappy bird clone already which is cool. It's an odd
        feeling to be an extremely capable programmer but not knowing how to create what seems like the easy 
        things like animations and images.
        It would be nice to work in a team with a designer who can really make the game shine. 
        From what I can tell from the last week, the details are what really give it that edge. As with anything
        if I don't become disinterested in it, I'll get better with practice. 
      </p>
      <p>
        That's it. I'll write my next post before bed to ensure the ultimate creativity of topics. Vi ses!

        I did laundry today and was reminded of how great clean sheets are, so here's an ode to clean sheets.<br><br>
        <b><u>Ode to Clean Sheets:</u></b><br>
        As soft as you feel,<br>
        as good as you smell,<br>
        the task of sleep<br>
        is a serene privilege.<br>
        Cotton embraces the<br>
        skin like warm motherly<br>
        hands, then patiently<br>
        waits for my return.<br>
        My slight grease and grime<br>
        erodes your appeal, but<br>
        yields a chance to enjoy<br>
        your presence every week.

        Last Friday night after my exam, I went to a pub with a few friends. I had ridden my bike for about five 
        minutes to a meeting location, locked my bike at a supermarket, then the group of us walked to the pub.
        After drinks and things wound down, I got back to my bike only to find my bike lock was jammed. I could 
        place the key all the way into the lock mechanism, but the key wouldn't turn at all. Chalking the 
        inconvenience up to a fluke of the cold weather, I walked all the way back. What would've taken me five
        minutes on a bike took me a half an hour by foot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, Saturday, I got up and walked all the way back out to the supermarket to find the exact
        same circumstances, a bike lock that just wouldn't open. I had been kind of lucky because the bike was 
        locked around to back tire to the frame and not to a fence or something. Maybe you're guessing what I'm 
        gonna say next. I carried my bike all the way back to Flogsta. A half hour walk turned into about an hour
        with lots of breaks to rest then picking up the bike again. I could let the front tire down as it was 
        free moving but I couldn't drag the back tire. I would've just found a bike shop to help me in my situation,
        but they were all closed for the weekend. In addition, I didn't want to just leave my bike at the 
        supermarket for two more days, so I carried it back. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a bike shop in Flogsta I was able to visit today where the owner let me use his giant wire cutters
        to cut the cheap bike lock. Of course I had to buy another bike lock in the old one's place, but I'm just
        glad I'm mobile again. Plus, the bike carrying was a great workout on Saturday I'm sure. I had a lot of
        time to think and be alone the whole way back too.

        I have yet another exam on Thursday, but I can't bring myself to do any good studying for it. I have this 
        problem from time to time where I hit a patch of a couple of weeks where I just don't want to do anything. 
        Now when I say I don't want to do 
        anything, I'm still doing plenty of coding, blog writing, drawing, reading, etc., I'm just not in the 
        mood to do what I'm supposed to. I had a bad case of it this last summer working on a part of Stuut
        that was particularly un-fun. I broke through it with some alcohol and discipline. Right now, I 
        believe my motivation for school or lack thereof to be coming from the apathy of the material. 
        Unlike my last slump, if this one is truly caused by class apathy, then it'll fix itself when I get
        new classes in a week. In the meantime however, I'll have to study for my exam all the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will say I'm starting to get excited by game development. I have a lot of mobile game development ideas
        bouncing around in my head, but am so new to the development environment that the time required to 
        implement said ideas is too much of a sacrifice during my exam week. My mobile game brainstorms
        are causing me to reminisce to the days of middle school with a game called Doodle Jump. My super good 
        friend at the time Ben Linky and I played the hell out of that game. I hope I can make a fun
        game even if it doesn't make any money; I'll just be glad to have people playing it. My Alexa skill 
        has a lot of success with hundreds of new users every single week, but I think this could be because
        of the niche market. The iOS app market on the other hand is saturated with games, 
        and I think my chances of a successful
        game are lesser. But like I said, I'm just hoping to make something enjoyable for my friends and me.
        I'll certainly let the blog know when I've got something good.

        How's it going? I think there's a saying about drinking alone, that it's a sign of alcoholism. What 
        about drinking alone, while creating a mobile game, and blogging simultaneously? I'm going to be blogging
        live and I'm gonna post this on facebook such that people can hear about my game process live. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome if you're coming from facebook. I'm going to post paragraphs fairly frequently, so you'll just 
        have to refresh the page and see the new paragraphs as they come.

        I had an exam this morning at 8am at a testing location that was 30 minutes away. Such a trip had 
        me waking up at 6:30. It's certainly a fact that people can write better when they're tired. I should
        qualify "better". Better meaning more creative. More thoughts run together and are less likely to 
        be filtered or inhibited, and that's good for creativity in writing. I hope the same thing is true 
        in game development, and with alcohol involved.

        I want to make a mobile game tonight reminiscent of "Jetpack Joyride". It was an endless runner mobile
        game from back in the day. I re-downloaded the game just a second ago and I have to say it's pretty 
        great even for today. The pixel art is awesome, the power-ups are satisfying, and the slot machine 
        at the end is a nice hook. I want to create the same type of mechanics but without a jetpack. I want
        my game to use a character that has the ability to flip gravity. The quick flip flop of the direction
        of gravity will allow the player to avoid obstacles, but we'll see what mechanics are actually fun
        once the game starts getting built. I'll try to post some videos as I'm going. 
      </p>
      <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" preload="auto" class="post_image" width="80%" controls>
        <source src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog123videos/video_1.MP4" type="video/mp4">

      </video>
      <p>
        Alright. I was able to get the mechanics of a sprite being affected by changing gravity done. 
        I stole the ground images from flappy bird. All will be polished soon, but I just need to get it 
        going right now. The simulator I'm using doesn't have the correct display aspect ratio so it's a 
        little blurry. The next step is to add some enemies. Should be straight forward.
