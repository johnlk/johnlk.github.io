      Welcome to John Kuhn's study abroad blog. This is simply to answer some of the questions 
      my family and friends constantly have about my trip. It also serves as a chance for me to go back 
      and reflect on my trip when my trip concludes, and I begin to start forgetting about the funnier  
      day to day events. I'm actively posting articles, so feel free to check back regularly. </p>

        The 18th marks my first day in Sweden. I had just spent around 13 hours traveling from O'Hare airport 
        to Arlanda in Sweden. Being as I couldn't get into my Uppsala apartment until Monday, 
        I spent the weekend in Stockholm which was just a 20 min train ride away. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The picture above is a photo I took almost immediately after I got off my plane after landing at Arlanda. 
        I had only received about 90 mins of sleep on the seven hour flight, and I certainly wouldn't describe it 
        as good sleep as the sleep came in irregular twenty minute intervals. I did enjoy that the plane had episodes 
        of "Nathan for You" to watch. I ended up watching all four of the available episodes. After getting off 
        the plane, getting my luggage, and asking someone about how to get to Stockholm, I was finally on a train 
        towards Stockholm. My first impression of Sweden is the green scenery. Lots of trees and green. The usual 
        corn and soybean fields I was used to seeing in Indiana were replaced by plains of green grass. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I had finally arrived in Stockholm it was around 7am, which was a late 1am at home. While I was tired 
        from traveling the past day and was wanting to rest, I needed to find a hotel to stay. Using google maps, I 
        lugged my luggage up the cobblestone roads looking for a hotel. I ended up stopping at three different 
        hotels all of which were full due to a festival being in town. After the third hotel, I booked a room at the 
        Sheraton online on my phone and hailed an Ãœber. I could've walked to the Sheraton as I had to the others, 
        but I was already sweating like crazy and didn't want to look any more out of place then I already knew I did. 
        As a side note, it was 65 degrees or so with a slight breeze which ended up being heavenly once I started 
        sweating, so it certainly could've been worse. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My room was super nice and featured a US outlet and a king size bed, which I would eventually pass out on 
        around 1pm for a three hour nap. My first meal in Stockholm was at a place called Max, which is probably 
        the Swedish equivalent of McDonalds. It was a pretty good burger with nothing unexpected. The Coke I had 
        ordered was just a slightly different taste than I was used to. The Coke in Stockholm had a slightly stronger 
        aftertaste; the pop was a bit more bitter than the U.S. version. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretty much everyone in Sweden speaks perfect English, and I never had any trouble navigating around the 
        city or talking to people. The English I hear in Sweden is even better than some of my professors at home, 
        but to be fair the Swedes have been learning English since elementary school.

        Today was a good day because I was able to get 10,000 steps in before noon just walking around exploring 
        the city. I was also able to meet up with some other Purdue students. These students were studying as 
        exchange students at the Swedish Royal Institute KTH in Stockholm. I was able to meet up with them at 
        a barbecue their school was having for their arriving international students. I was worried I wouldn't 
        be able to enter because I didn't have the wristband denoting a KTH international student, but it worked 
        out because they let me in anyway. This barbecue had Germans, Austrians, Spaniards, you name it. I was 
        able to talk with a couple Catalans from Madrid that spoke really good English. It was great because 
        although everyone was from different countries, they all spoke in English to each other. English is the 
        universal language everyone is learning, especially if you're an engineering student in Europe. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I was able to end my day hanging out with those Purdue students and an Austrian student we had met. 
        We went out and got a drink at a place we had found on an app that displayed bars with beers under 30 
        krona, which is like $3.30. It was my very first time in a bar as I'm only 20 and that doesn't fly in 
        the U.S.; however, the Europeans didn't even check my ID. Different cultures are great.

        Today was my first day to Uppsala. I was staying in the Sheraton downtown Stockholm for the weekend 
        and needed to checkout by noon that day. I was on a bit of a schedule because I had to make it to 
        my apartment building while it was still open from 13:00 - 16:00. As my luck had it, the moment I 
        found my train, the doors closed on me like a movie. There was a woman there who was super nice and 
        told me the next train to Uppsala was coming in a half hour. About a $10 mistake for being just 30 
        seconds late, but no harm no foul.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went ahead and bought the next train's tickets on my phone which went fine, expect that it never 
        emailed me my ticket, just a credit card confirmation. I downloaded the SJ app for Swedish trains and 
        tried to download my ticket there, but all I could get was the ticket for the last train. Now I worried 
        about not having a ticket and boarding the train, and the idea of presenting the old ticket crossed my 
        mind. They let me on without having to show my ticket, but I knew they would be sending a guy to come 
        check the ticket I didn't have. Keep in mind, everything on the app was totally in Swedish, and I was 
        still attempting to download my ticket on my phone. Sure enough, here comes the ticket checking guy. I 
        was able to explain my situation in English, which he understood, and I showed him my purchase number 
        which was good enough for him, so it all worked out, as most things do. Really there's no reason to worry 
        ever. Even had I been arrested for not paying my ticket, I could've appeared on that TV show "Locked Up 
        Abroad", maybe even received a book deal too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uppsala ended up being a great choice as the city is even more beautiful than Stockholm was, and it has 
        tons of people outdoors with their dogs or on their bikes. In fact, it reminded me about a conversation 
        I had with a Swedish professor on my plane rider over. She said there's a running joke that every Swedish 
        student puts "love being outdoors" for the hobbies section on their resumes. The picture I posted for this 
        entry is actually a castle built in 1549, super old. Uppsala University is super old too, founded in 1477 
        makes it the oldest university in Scandinavia and fourth oldest in all of Europe. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I successfully got into my apartment and got settled in. Only one other person that I can tell is moved 
        in on my hall. Unlike the KTH students I had met over the weekend, most Uppsala students are waiting to 
        arrive for another week because classes don't start for another two.
