This repository host my Global Visualation at https://johnlk.github.io/webgl-globe-master/globe-search/index.html

This repo was created with the code found at https://github.com/dataarts/webgl-globe , a framework for 3d global renderings.

Go to https://johnlk.github.io/webgl-globe-master/globe-search/index.html to see a 3d representation of the airports around the world and their flight volumes.
Greater volume of flights is reprensented in tall poles off the earth.

Each airport is given a color at random.

Airport data and information was taken from http://openflights.org/data.html . They had data on airport location and day to day flights.
