          Apple with the release of their XR phones have decided to make another part
          of my life just a little bit more annoying. I'm sure you've experienced it if
          you've ever tried to upload one of your iPhone photos. Apple is now using
          the .HEIC (high efficiency image compression) file format for their photos,
          which means you can't just airdrop and go when trying to impress your friends
          on slack or any other major application.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">The goal</h2>

        <p>
          Automatically convert all .HEIC photos to .jpg when
          added to our "~/Downloads" directory.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can use fswatch to wait for changes to the downloads directory,
          then convert the image files to jpg with a command line tool called imagemagick.
          Simple enough.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Setup</h2>

        <p>
          Let's install
          fswatch which works for all major operating systems. I'm working on a
          mac so I'm going to install with <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="language-bash">
            $ brew install fswatch
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Following fswatch's <a href="https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch/wiki/How-to-Use-fswatch">documentation</a>
          we can watch for our Downloads directory with this command. 
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="language-bash">
            $ fswatch -0 ~/Downloads | xargs -0 -I {} sh -c 'echo ${}'
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          This will listen for changes on our Downloads directory and then spit out changes
          to std output. The xargs command is cleaning up our input by ignoring null spaces
          and passing off our file name. Now if we can run this command and add a file to our
          downloads directory we'll see this.
        </p>

          That's great but now we need a way to convert heic files from the command line.
          Let's install imagemagick with:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="language-bash">
            $ brew install imagemagick
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          This allows us to run something like this to convert our file.
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="language-bash">
            $ magick convert example_image.HEIC example_image.jpg
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Great! We're almost there. We just need our bash script to look for heic files
          and then use our magick converter. If you're a masochist you can try to come
          up with the bash script on your own. Otherwise, I'll show you mine.
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="language-bash">
            filepath=$1
            extension="${1##*.}"
            path_without_extension="${filepath%.*}"

            if [ "$extension" == "heic" ] || [ "$extension" == "HEIC" ]; then
              `magick convert $filepath ${path_without_extension}.jpg`
            fi
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Go ahead and save this bash script somewhere safe and for
          good measure make it executable. I called mine heic_to_png.bash
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="language-bash">
            $ chmod +x heic_to_png.bash
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Lastly, run this to start the process of watching your downloads dir.
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="language-bash">
            $ fswatch -0 ~/Downloads | xargs -0 -I {} sh -c '~/heic_to_png.bash {}'
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Fin</h2>

        <p>
          You can now airdrop and upload images without worry of HEIC inhabitants,
          congrats! You could also add this to your startup script for good measure.
