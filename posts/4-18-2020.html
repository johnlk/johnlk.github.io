        <p>
          Our company has been working from home for about 6 weeks now, and most all
          of our communication has been over slack. Any sort of personality you've worked
          hard to build in the office has to be converted into a steady stream of gifs.
          I figured it might be more enjoyable looking at slack if there were a
          fun and lighthearted bot responding and livening up the chat.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">The goal</h2>

        <p>
          I want to build out a passive slack bot that quietly does things in the background
          without announcement. I would rather have an end user be surprised and pleased the
          bot did something rather than having to remember all the commands associated with
          it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I figure I can achieve this with two different ideas. One, have the bot insert
          gifs for all one word messages, and two, create a secret password game like on 
          Pee-wee's playhouse. I figure anytime an employee uses the password in a message
          the bot let's us know by sending a specific password gif.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Auto Gif Sending</h2>

        <p>
          Luckily, our company already has a slackbot called "Marvin" which does things like
          tell us about open pull requests and taking notes on Airtable. We have a heroku http
          server hosting our bot, and we also have StatusCake ping the instance every 5 mins
          to keep it alive without having to upgrade from the free tier. For our bot, we built
          it on ruby using the <a href="https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot">ruby
          slack bot</a> gem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using the match feature, we can construct a regex which looks for just one word
          messages.
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="language-ruby">
            require 'slack-ruby-bot'

            class ChatBot < SlackRubyBot::Bot
              match /^(?<single_word>\w+)$/ do |client, data, match|
                client.say(text: match[:single_word], channel: data.channel)
              end
            end

            ChatBot.run
          </code>
        </pre>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          This block tells the bot to respond back the word just sent for all one word messages.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          You can run your chatbot with this command.
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="language-bash">
            $ SLACK_API_TOKEN=... bundle exec ruby chatbot.rb
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Pulling in the <a href="https://developers.giphy.com/">Giphy API</a> using the
          <a href="https://github.com/Giphy/giphy-ruby-client">Giphy Client</a> gem, we can do
          something like this.
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="language-ruby">
            require 'slack-ruby-bot'

            class ChatBot < SlackRubyBot::Bot
              match /^(?<single_word>\w+)$/ do |client, data, match|
                api_instance = GiphyClient::DefaultApi.new

                api_key = 'YOUR_GIPHY_API_KEY'
                opts = { 
                  limit: 1,
                  offset: rand(25), # get a random offset, to keep it interesting
                  rating: "g",
                  lang: "en",
                  fmt: "json"
                }

                result = api_instance.gifs_search_get(api_key, match[:single_word], opts)

                # result is an array of gifs, so let's grab the first one
                client.say(text: result.data.first&.url, channel: data.channel)
              end
            end

            ChatBot.run
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          That wasn't so bad at all. And here's the result:
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">The Password Game</h2>

        <p>
          Once again, with the password game we want to be searching all messages for a regex
          match, but this time we want to allow the match to happen anywhere in the message.
          We can use the gem's scan method to look for a match in any part of the message.
          Let's start with a regular expression like this.
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="language-ruby">
            require 'slack-ruby-bot'

            class ChatBot < SlackRubyBot::Bot
              secret_word = "tacos"

              scan (/(#{secret_word})/) do |client, data, _match|
                # celebratory gif
                secret_word_gif = "https://media.giphy.com/media/14ytbNcL4X2gVi/giphy.gif"
                client.say(text: secret_word_gif, channel: data.channel)
              end
            end

            ChatBot.run
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Great. This code snippet will allow our bot to place a gif anytime we have a message
          with the hidden password. But what if we want to play too, and don't want to have
          to deploy every time we change the password? Can we generate one? For that, I found
          this simple to use gem called <a href="https://github.com/schmich/spicy-proton">Spicy
          Proton</a>. Word generation is as easy as
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="language-ruby">
            secret_word = Spicy::Proton.noun
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Finally, let's supply a couple of commands to allow the user to guess the secret word,
          and another for giving up and asking what the secret word is.
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code class="language-ruby">
            require 'slack-ruby-bot'

            class ChatBot < SlackRubyBot::Bot
              secret_word = "tacos"

              command 'what\'s the password?' do |client, data, _match|
                client.say(text: secret_word, channel: data.channel)
              end
          
              command 'the password is' do |client, data, match|
                guessed_word = match['expression']
          
                if guessed_word == secret_word
                  client.say(text: "Well done!", channel: data.channel)
                  # reset the secret word
                  secret_word = Spicy::Proton.noun
                else
                  client.say(text: "Not quite!", channel: data.channel)
                end
              end

              scan (/(#{secret_word})/) do |client, data, _match|
                # celebratory gif
                secret_word_gif = "https://media.giphy.com/media/14ytbNcL4X2gVi/giphy.gif"
                client.say(text: secret_word_gif, channel: data.channel)
              end
            end

            ChatBot.run
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          That's all folks, and it didn't take too much work to make it happen. In the following
          example "chive" is the password.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Future Work</h2>

        <p>
          It might be nice to work on a leader board of users who have guessed the secret word
          the most. Or a cron job that displays at the end of the day what the most commonly
          used emjoi's were. Write me if you'd like to see these come to life.
