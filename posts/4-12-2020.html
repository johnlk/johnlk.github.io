          Living in San Francisco and wanting to use my amazon gift card on non-frivolous
          expenditures, I've been fighting the war of trying to place an amazon fresh order.
          This post was originally going to be a walk through of some sort of app using an
          Amazon api to alert you when a delivery slot became available. However, Amazon
          has no such open API, and a coworker shared a project achieving this exact
          goal anyway. They get around not having an api by running a chrome webdriver with
          selenium. This just has a bot refresh the page looking for html elements which
          may or may not contain strings like, "no deliveries available".

        <h2 class="section-heading">The Inspiration</h2>

        <p>
          Later in the weekend, I was reading a translated version of the non-canonical gospel
          of Judas. Looking at this old non-stylish website serving a pretty unique document,
          I wondered where the server hosting the page was located. This is actually a pretty
          easy thing to uncover. I just pinged the domain in my terminal which resolved an
          IP for me, then I googled the IP. Although the result wasn't that exciting (a 
          square space site hosted in New York), I still thought it would be cool to have a
          browser extension that told you where a site's info was coming from.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">The goal</h2>

        <p>
          Make a chrome extension which produces information about the current's sites server.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Doing it</h2>

        <p>
          Thanks to this super helpful
          <a href="https://ip-api.com/docs/api:json">
            API
          </a>
          which takes a domain string or an IP address and returns the location and info about
          it, we're almost halfway there. Unfortunately, the API and most others like it were
          using an HTTP request and eventually would be blocked by an HTTPS mixed content error.
          I don't think I could feel good about making an extension which required users to set
          COORS settings on their browser to use it, and so, I decided to do something else.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a compromise, I guess we could make a bash script which does this for us pretty
          quickly.
